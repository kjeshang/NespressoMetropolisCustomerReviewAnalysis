## Introduction
This project was created to assist the Nespresso Metrotown Boutique understand its service quality in terms of customer experience and optimal execution of business operations. As management of the Boutique predominantly refers to Google Reviews to periodically assess service quality, the data utilized for this project were Google Reviews received between 2019 to 2022. Thus, reviews received in 2023 were not considered for analysis. In turn, this project is a cumulative annual analysis of our service quality until 2022 year-end.

Below is a list of the five stages the project followed through.
1. Data Scraping/Extraction
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Sentiment Analysis - Exploration
5. Sentiment Analysis - Predictive Modeling

This project was completed using the following devices, tools, and technologies.
* Devices & Platforms
    * ASUS VivoBook - Windows 11 (8GB RAM); used for data scraping/extraction
    * Macbook Air 2014 - Mac OS X BigSur (4GB RAM); used for all stages _after_ data scraping/extraction
* Scripting
    * Programming Language: Python
        * Official Version 3.10.1 using Asus VivoBook; used for data scraping/extraction
        * Anaconda Navigator version (3.9.11) using Macbook Air 2014; used for all stages _after_ data scraping/extraction
    * Packages: Selenium (with ChromeDriver.exe), Datetime/Time/Dateutil, Pandas, Numpy, Re, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud, TQDM, itertools, NLTK, String, TextBlob, NRCLex, Scikit Learn

    * Software 
        * Microsoft Visual Studio Code; used for data scraping/extraction
        * Anaconda Navigator; used for all stages _after_ data scraping/extraction

## Data Cleaning

In this stage of the project, the Google Reviews data is cleaned for any data scraping errors & inconsistencies. There is transformation of the dataset to include new columns that are more meaningful for the later stages of the project.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

This stage is somewhat self explanatory, but it is important in order to get "a feel" of the now cleaned Google Reviews dataset by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
