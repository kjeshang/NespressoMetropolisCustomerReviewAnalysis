First time at this store as we had bought the machine & coffee online. Wandered around trying to figure out how to buy coffee as there was none to be seen. There are kiosks set up,  so we approached one to try to figure things out. A salesperson finally asked us if we needed help. Yes wonderful. There is a clipboard with the coffees listed but no prices. She asks for my number so she can pull up my account. The first thing she tells me is that I don't qualify for the deal, but doesn't explain what the deal is. I ask her why not & it's because I haven't registered my machine on my account. Okay whatever, I just want coffee. So I ask her how this works. She explains the new coffees they have available. So I ask her what are the prices, she tells me (more than once), that they are the same prices as on their website. So finally I say to her well I don't have my phone in front of me & I don't have the prices memorized so is there a list of prices? No, she has to write them down. How does a store not have the prices of the items they are selling? Anyway, once we established the prices, we ordered our coffee, paid & within a couple of minutes she had our order ready to go. I think I would skip the store & stick to buying the coffee online, but you need to buy I believe 120 pods, which can run you about $150 to qualify for free shipping. As those are the only two methods to buying the Vertuo pods, I really wish I had thought all of this through before buying the machine, c'est la vie.\", ' 1 star ']\n",
