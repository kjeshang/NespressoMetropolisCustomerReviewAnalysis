After spending $60 on coffee I asked if there were samples and was responded with a quick no.  Mean while I look over and they are handing coffees out and people drinking them at the bar.

I simply asked how her day was going and she’s like “I don’t want to keep answering that question” in a harsh tone and said what do you need. Awkwardly, I was like okaaay. I also needed an item which had to do with the machine and didn’t know the name and her tone back to me was completely unacceptable as well as through the entire transaction. I never write negative reviews because I own a retail business and customer service is huge for me. But I thought I needed to share. Not a pleasant experience at all. If that’s the type of store you’ve built and you want people to come up and have that experience then provide a great experience because at the end of the day it’s loyal customers like myself and others keeping the business going.',\n",

I have asked one of the assistants about the descaling process of my machine that did not work and I poured all the descaling things out into the sink and it did not help me at all. I have mentioned the waste and the cost to the assistant. Her response was unprofessional as she was saying that the cost of the product was only $11 and it is not a big deal. I understand that it is not a lot but it is money that I have literally wasted for nothing. Now, I feel self-doubt in the financial way.

The SA today was utterly uninterested in working at all, would not help with selection of pods, rolled her eyes several times, did not tell me the total price of the items until I asked her with roll of her eyes, and just handed me the items and walked away after I paid.

The transaction appeared to not go thru because my cart still shows the things I have ordered.  I checked Paypal and found out that my account was already charged.  I called customer service and was made to wait for 45 minutes.  Finally when someone answered, they did not provide anything to help me out and cannot even access my online account and cart to find out if my order did go thru. I checked my email and I only got confirmation from my creditcard company that a charge for Nespresso did go thru.  Next day I checked my email again and found a reply from Nespresso saying that my order is being prepared but no order number.  I called customer service again and was made to wait AGAIN for 45 minutes and when someone finally answered they could not even give me an order number so I can have the reassurance that my order went thru. My orders at this time are still in my cart, my card has been charged and no one can definitively say that my order went thru.  THIRD DAY I received another email saying that my order is on its way.  I called Customer service again and was made to wait AGAIN for another 45 minutes. This time they gave me an order number but still not answer why my orders were still in my cart.  I am really disappointed at Nespressos customer service hotline.  This truly negates the \"exclusive\" and high end coffee experience the brand is offering. Im not impressed.',\n",
