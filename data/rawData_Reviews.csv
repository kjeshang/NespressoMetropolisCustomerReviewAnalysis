Linda Wilke,4 reviews,4 weeks ago,"Tried calling this boutique to ask some questions about their machines and coffees, but wasn't able to connect directly with them by phone.  We took the risk and drove out from the Fraser Valley (50ish minutes).  We spent less than 5 minutes in the store, as the employee couldn't answer our questions about the different Vurtuo coffees (I was hoping for something similar in taste to the Fortisso lungo of the original line) and we weren't allowed to try any samples (instead we were directed to your downtown location).  Bring back the ability to try your coffee and bring back another 'pop up' further East.  Not all your customers live close to Vancouver/Burnaby.", 2 stars

Connor Gyori,4 reviews,2 months ago,I will never be shopping at this location again.  The staff member (male with a beard) was extremely rude and condescending.  I may I don’t dress like your “regular” customer but after waiting 10 mins to be helped as he pretended to be busy around me finally helped me with straight attitude.  After spending $60 on coffee I asked if there were samples and was responded with a quick no.  Mean while I look over and they are handing coffees out and people drinking them at the bar.  I felt disgusted by his behaviour and would have returned my purchase but I never want to step foot in there again., 1 star 
Abdo AK,1 review,2 months ago,Horrible staff will still come back for the great coffee unfortunately, 2 stars 
Daisy,18 reviews,2 months ago,(Translated by Google) I would rather shop online. Do you have to queue up to sell a few capsules and think you are Hermes? I don’t know who arranged it. All the products in this store are put in the back. I just want to check out and leave., 3 stars

Angelica Largo,8 reviews,3 months ago,I visit this Nespresso every week to stock up on my favourite pods. I've always liked the customer service and quick in store shopping process. I really recommend trying their seasonal coffee's they are the best!, 5 stars 
Nero K,2 reviews,4 months ago,"Kudos to Ali and Kunal! They should be your go to representatives if you care about the customer service. Went to the boutique today for my monthly coffee run and while paying for the sleeves I got, I randomly remembered that I never got the $30 coffee credit that I was supposed to get when I purchased the machine last year (was a promotion at that time) so I asked Kunal about it. Kunal started helping me to find solutions to that but it wasn’t a big deal to me and the boutique was starting to get busy so I told him not to worry about it but Kunal and Ali made sure that they still take care of their customer and gave me 3 sleeves at no charge which made my day!", 5 stars

I remember that I wrote a review here before and complained that the staff didn’t paid enough attention while I was visiting their store. Next time when I went to the shop,to get some coffe,Scott,Their manager,That’s right,the big tall guy wearing glasses ,Confronted me and yelling at me to remove my review or I wouldn’t be welcomed in their store anymore in an indirect way. I was afraid of my safety and so I did just that! But I am no longer visiting that horrible business of theirs. Please stay away from Scott and specially this location if you like to feel safe.", 1 star 
Aapkaran Sidhu,Local Guide · 36 reviews,6 months ago,"Great coffee. Fairly reprehensible service on all 3 occasions. This place could benefit hugely from becoming a self-serve vending machine. But Ill say again, great product!", 2 stars 
Maninderpal Singh Brar,Local Guide · 13 reviews,6 months ago,The Gentleman working there wanted to give me a gift as a loyal customer and told me I will get 8 sleeves instead of 7 what I ordered. (surprise sleeve on any order of 5 Sleeves as I got an email also)., 1 star 
cat ng,1 review,6 months ago,"Great service by a young staff ""Shu"" if I remembered his name correctly. He answered all my questions in details and served me a great cup of coffee. He explained the coffee in details. Very impressive service, for sure will come back again.", 5 stars 
Mahtab,8 reviews,6 months ago,"I would give no stars! We have been Nespresso’s loyal customer for over 10 years, but the new coffee machine that we bought from Nespresso was faulty and was nothing like the old ones that we had. I had to return it after a few use. After talking to a Nespresso customer service agent, we went to this store to return the machine. The manager on duty was rude, not helpful and gave me and my family hard time while we had already talked to the customer service and they left a note on my account that the faulty coffee machine was returnable, but she refused to help us and raised her voice on us and didn’t have respectful and proper attitude to us. We went to a different Nespresso store and they helped us respectfully in a professional and great manner. I won’t get back to this store, where I’m not treated well.", 1 star 
Kat,4 reviews,6 months ago,"My husband and I went to the store to try out the new limited edition pods. When we stepped in, all the employees were occupied so we were browsing while waiting. One of the employee lady was standing at the cashier staring at us and started waving her fingers to come over as if she was calling her dog… when we got to her, there was no greeting and jumped straight to asking what we want… it was not a pleasant first impression.", 1 star 
H K,7 reviews,6 months ago,"I went to Nespresso Metrotown today and had great service, It wasn't busy and the customer service staff said hi when I was in the line, one of the ladies and a gentleman helped me out with my purchase of some decaf capsules! They talked to me about their iced lime capsule I can't remember the name, and I was given my order is beautiful floral bags and before I left I was given a recipe card with iced summer drink recipes on it!! Thank you so much Nespresso Metrotown for the great help as usual!!", 5 stars 
Gary,Local Guide · 25 reviews,6 months ago,Worst customer service. Asked 3 different associates the same question. They all kept going back to the manager who kept avoiding customers. It's 8pm on a Monday why can't you spend 2 minutes to explain something for me. Instead she relayed 3 different answers through her associates., 1 star

omeed rahimzadeh,Local Guide · 64 reviews,8 months ago,I gave these guys a five-star before for customer service because of the gentleman who was helping me and his name was Mehdi. He was the customer service manager and he was very good. I went there today to get coffee after my 3 months coffee run and the service was very bad I was not very impressed because the gentleman who was helping me he's no longer at that location and he got moved up to a different location in manager position of the store I was very disappointed at the customer service that I got and will not go back there to this location ever again I will not recommend this place because the customer service is not what used to be I'm very disappointed and I hope the management fix this problem. The people who work at this location do not care about customer service and they're very rude, 1 star

Brigitte Raja,1 review,8 months ago,Terrible experience at the Nespresso store today. This is my first time writing a review and only because I’m shocked by the rude customer service. My family and I went into the store to buy a couple sleeves of pods. We asked one of the employees questions about the flavours as we had purchased our first ever machine last week. She was very rude and you could tell that she did not want to be there. She made us feel like we were asking stupid questions and didn’t even answer the question. We immediately said okay thanks and walked out. Do Nespresso employees not get training on how to provide customer service? Why do they all look like they hate their lives? So disappointed., 1 star 
Asif Isma'il,Local Guide · 10 reviews,8 months ago,"Extremely rude staffs. If you are a minority, you are likely to be told, not asked, where to stand and what to do even in a quiet store. Given the opportunity to ask question, is nothing but a privilege but be ready for the question to be thrown back at you and you will be told to choose another brand over Nespresso. As being told and I am quoting ‘Nespresso is not for everyone’.", 1 star

The clerk tried to help me my unreceived free cups( with online order before) she brought her manager but the  manager( Feb 20. Around 1:40pm) , she treated me like a black consumer ( to get a “free” stuffs). In the note ( in the computer system) said clearly I didn’t get my free cups but the manager said note is vague. What kind of cups are. Etc…gee. It is there problem . The boutique should be there to help their customers. Manager has no attitude at all.", 1 star

Zee Ray,11 reviews,a year ago,"The customer service I received today was absolutely terrible. My family and I spend hundreds of dollars each year. I dealt with a short haired girl  working in the morning today. I simply asked how her day was going and she’s like “I don’t want to keep answering that question” in a harsh tone and said what do you need. Awkwardly, I was like okaaay. I also needed an item which had to do with the machine and didn’t know the name and her tone back to me was completely unacceptable as well as through the entire transaction. I never write negative reviews because I own a retail business and customer service is huge for me. But I thought I needed to share. Not a pleasant experience at all. If that’s the type of store you’ve built and you want people to come up and have that experience then provide a great experience because at the end of the day it’s loyal customers like myself and others keeping the business going.", 1 star 
mike garcia,16 reviews,a year ago,"NEVER SHOPPING HERE. Such a negative attentive from the assistance working at front - both verbally and physical. For instance, her voice had a lot of sarcasm as she answer the questions that were being asked of her in regards to the espressos pods. Second, she pretty much threw the bag of my purchase to my hand. It made my experience as a shopper very uncomfortable and irritating.", 1 star

Vincent S,65 reviews,a year ago,Bought my Nespresso Vertuo machine yesterday with extra 20 pods Kunal was friendly and very informative today I came back to check on their coffee mugs but he was not the same as Yesterday no hello or did not ask me if I need anything he was just by the door telling people where to go same as yesterday he was by the door but he approached me if I needed anything. I wanted to buy a coffee mugs but no one help me so I left I think I’ll just buy my Nespresso at Richmond Centre it’s closer to me anyways., 2 stars 
Evan,26 reviews,a year ago,"Had a horrible experience here. The female worker clearly was trying to make a commission or was not trained properly to explain the most basic concepts. For example, I was led to believe that the minimum you can buy was 80 dollars worth of pods only to later realize that was BS. She had a grin on her face after I realized such. Will definitely never come to this place again.", 1 star

Nadiia Lolieva,2 reviews,a year ago,"I have been using the Nespresso coffee machine for a year now. I have gone to this location for so many times. Overall, everything was fine until today. I have asked one of the assistants about the descaling process of my machine that did not work and I poured all the descaling things out into the sink and it did not help me at all. I have mentioned the waste and the cost to the assistant. Her response was unprofessional as she was saying that the cost of the product was only $11 and it is not a big deal. I understand that it is not a lot but it is money that I have literally wasted for nothing. Now, I feel self-doubt in the financial way. I advise you to train the staff at the store since I am working in same the field and know how to work with customers. Thank you.", 3 stars

Farah J,Local Guide · 22 reviews,a year ago,"Very disappointed with my purchase today. I was told that if I buy 10 boxes of pods, I will get two boxes for free. After I paid, I found out that they ran out of one of the pods that were part of the promotion. I asked if I could get a substitute, was told I couldn’t. Isn’t there better planning when promotions are run? I bought 10 boxes so I could get the 2 bonus boxes as mentioned, not one bonus box. If I had known that this wasn’t the case, I wouldn’t have purchased 10 boxes of pods. Not cool.", 5 stars 
Carlos Valencia Chias,3 reviews,a year ago,"Pretty forgettable experience.

However, customer service at this location was just unacceptable today. I've been in the store couple of times now - and have had decent help from SA so far. The SA today was utterly uninterested in working at all, would not help with selection of pods, rolled her eyes several times, did not tell me the total price of the items until I asked her with roll of her eyes, and just handed me the items and walked away after I paid. I have worked in the service industry previously and I cannot fathom being that rude to anyone I come across in life - let alone a paying customer.", 2 stars

Chris Albert de Leon,Local Guide · 58 reviews,2 years ago,"This is not for their boutique but for their online store.   I am a long-time nespresso customer.  I ordered a few items online thru my phone and was supposed to pay via paypal.  The transaction appeared to not go thru because my cart still shows the things I have ordered.  I checked Paypal and found out that my account was already charged.  I called customer service and was made to wait for 45 minutes.  Finally when someone answered, they did not provide anything to help me out and cannot even access my online account and cart to find out if my order did go thru. I checked my email and I only got confirmation from my creditcard company that a charge for Nespresso did go thru.  Next day I checked my email again and found a reply from Nespresso saying that my order is being prepared but no order number.  I called customer service again and was made to wait AGAIN for 45 minutes and when someone finally answered they could not even give me an order number so I can have the reassurance that my order went thru. My orders at this time are still in my cart, my card has been charged and no one can definitively say that my order went thru.  THIRD DAY I received another email saying that my order is on its way.  I called Customer service again and was made to wait AGAIN for another 45 minutes. This time they gave me an order number but still not answer why my orders were still in my cart.  I am really disappointed at Nespressos customer service hotline.  This truly negates the ""exclusive"" and high end coffee experience the brand is offering. Im not impressed.", 2 stars 
Calvin Ivy,Local Guide · 138 reviews,2 years ago,This rating is specifically regarding the customer service at the Metrotown store.

Graham Wynne,Local Guide · 103 reviews,2 years ago,This place has probably the worst customer service of any retail location I have been to. They do have a couple of employees who are pleasant and professional but as a whole the location is terrible with almost zero customer service. The staff turnover is brutal which is likely indicative of the poor management shown everytime I attend. I now try to purchase all of my needs online to avoid it., 2 stars

Paul Sunner,6 reviews,3 years ago,Metrotown Nespresso very understaffed!! there is a huge lineup so even getting replacement pods seems like you are lining up for a nightclub due to some machine on special.  it should not be this hard to buy replacement coffee pods one should be able to walk in grab some coffee  and leave and not wait in line to have some sales specialist walk  you around like your buying a car or a house for this reason im going to go back to keurig at least i can buy the coffee at a costco save on    safeway etc!!, 1 star

Heaven forbid I just grab what I want and pay for it. What's the point having this machine if it's such a pain to get coffee for it. Makes me wanna sell my machine and not having to come back.

inspiringfoodie,Local Guide · 220 reviews,3 years ago,"Never thought buying coffee would be such a pretensious experience. First time at this store as we had bought the machine & coffee online. Wandered around trying to figure out how to buy coffee as there was none to be seen. There are kiosks set up,  so we approached one to try to figure things out. A salesperson finally asked us if we needed help. Yes wonderful. There is a clipboard with the coffees listed but no prices. She asks for my number so she can pull up my account. The first thing she tells me is that I don't qualify for the deal, but doesn't explain what the deal is. I ask her why not & it's because I haven't registered my machine on my account. Okay whatever, I just want coffee. So I ask her how this works. She explains the new coffees they have available. So I ask her what are the prices, she tells me (more than once), that they are the same prices as on their website. So finally I say to her well I don't have my phone in front of me & I don't have the prices memorized so is there a list of prices? No, she has to write them down. How does a store not have the prices of the items they are selling? Anyway, once we established the prices, we ordered our coffee, paid & within a couple of minutes she had our order ready to go. I think I would skip the store & stick to buying the coffee online, but you need to buy I believe 120 pods, which can run you about $150 to qualify for free shipping. As those are the only two methods to buying the Vertuo pods, I really wish I had thought all of this through before buying the machine, c'est la vie.", 1 star

I cant drink Starbucks regular coffee because the acid. But You must try a vanilla roast latte. It's free and trust me so worth the time to go into the mall and relax and have a free latte. Something about their coffee and brewing machine just make it perfection. Only downside is I have a tassimo at home and am planning on switching but only when a sale comes along as the machine I want is $500 😳  a bit on the pricey side., 5 stars

I've saved money from buying coffee everyday buy just using my VirtuoLine machine instead for a perfect cup that is reasonably priced. Other coffees taste like water now... You can really taste the difference., 5 stars

Brent de Waal,Local Guide · 93 reviews,4 years ago,"This is a nice new design store. There are lots of ""pods"" to order the coffee at with all the selections laid out under acrylic for ease of remembering the many different coffee types. After you order and pay. You can sit at one of the many counters and your order is brought to you with a coffee if you like. Very quick efficient and fast. Nice store.", 5 stars

Greg Domville,Local Guide · 402 reviews,4 years ago,Check it out. Period. I'm a coffee snob and this is the best coffee ever!!!!!! It's worth making the investment if you really like coffee. And to visit the boutique locations is an experience not an errand. You feel like you're in first class on an airplane. Come on Canada. Tim Hortons coffee is awful. Nespresso is where its at.

Ingrid Nagle,Local Guide · 45 reviews,4 years ago,Always great customer service. Really take the time to explain the flavour profiles of all their coffees. Even to someone like me who has no idea what they're talking about but enjoy the taste non the less :), 5 stars

JJ BGS,Local Guide · 55 reviews,4 years ago,"We usually get our cups via amazon. We were in the area so we figured we'd stop by. I'll keep it short-if you are not George Clooney expect some snootiness and attitude. We were served asap but our questions were met with attitude. Amazon gives us a few flavors so we asked the barista if we could mix and match. He gave us a confused look and said no, then went on to explain that the cups were not that expensive. We then went on to ask if we could have our free cup of coffee. He then went on to explain that they don't call them free because free denotes less class. They are called ""tasting cups."" Here's the thing Nespresso, if the cup doesn't cost me money, it is in fact a ""free"" cup of coffee. I don't need your barista to tell me otherwise. Anyways, awesome machine, great coffee. You'll probably never change but I'll be back to ask for my free cup of coffee.", 1 star

Pranjali Viral T,Local Guide · 100 reviews,4 years ago,"We are Nespresso club member for past few years now. I absolutely love the smooth espresso that is made in my Nespresso machine. I was waiting for long time for a close by location in Burnaby and I was super excited to visit the Nespresso store in Metrotown today. As usual, amazing coffee with excellent service...", 5 stars 
Kevin Lee,Local Guide · 151 reviews,4 years ago,Like another post said waited 30m. Was interested in trying before buying. Once i got inside I had to wait another 15 to order a drink. Didn't bother as the barista was obviously ignoring us. Will happily keep my Keurig or any pricier product and forgo any chance I would spend any money on this brand. Even George Clooney himself couldn't save your brand. Waste of time..., 1 star 
George Gunay,5 reviews,4 years ago,I suggest you to switch to another brand. I am here to buy some coffee but I can't. I have been on the line up for 30 min and store is empty., 1 star
