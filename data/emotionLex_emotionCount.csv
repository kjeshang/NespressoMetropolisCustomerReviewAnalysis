Connor Gyori,No Title,4,I will never be shopping at this location again.  The staff member (male with a beard) was extremely rude and condescending.  I may I don’t dress like your “regular” customer but after waiting 10 mins to be helped as he pretended to be busy around me finally helped me with straight attitude.  After spending $60 on coffee I asked if there were samples and was responded with a quick no.  Mean while I look over and they are handing coffees out and people drinking them at the bar.  I felt disgusted by his behaviour and would have returned my purchase but I never want to step foot in there again.,1,2022,2 months ago,2023-01-29 20:55:10,never shopping location staff member male extremely rude condescending dress regular customer waiting mins helped pretended busy around finally helped straight attitude spending coffee asked samples responded quick mean look handing coffees people drinking bar felt disgusted behaviour returned purchase never want step foot,0,0,2,2,2,3,3,0,1,2

My family and I went into the store to buy a couple sleeves of pods. We asked one of the employees questions about the flavours as we had purchased our first ever machine last week. She was very rude and you could tell that she did not want to be there. She made us feel like we were asking stupid questions and didn’t even answer the question. We immediately said okay thanks and walked out. Do Nespresso employees not get training on how to provide customer service? Why do they all look like they hate their lives?

Chris Albert de Leon,Local Guide,58,"This is not for their boutique but for their online store.   I am a long-time nespresso customer.  I ordered a few items online thru my phone and was supposed to pay via paypal.  The transaction appeared to not go thru because my cart still shows the things I have ordered.  I checked Paypal and found out that my account was already charged.  I called customer service and was made to wait for 45 minutes.  Finally when someone answered, they did not provide anything to help me out and cannot even access my online account and cart to find out if my order did go thru. I checked my email and I only got confirmation from my creditcard company that a charge for Nespresso did go thru.  Next day I checked my email again and found a reply from Nespresso saying that my order is being prepared but no order number.  I called customer service again and was made to wait AGAIN for 45 minutes and when someone finally answered they could not even give me an order number so I can have the reassurance that my order went thru. My orders at this time are still in my cart, my card has been charged and no one can definitively say that my order went thru.  THIRD DAY I received another email saying that my order is on its way.  I called Customer service again and was made to wait AGAIN for another 45 minutes. This time they gave me an order number but still not answer why my orders were still in my cart.

inspiringfoodie,Local Guide,220,"Never thought buying coffee would be such a pretensious experience. First time at this store as we had bought the machine & coffee online. Wandered around trying to figure out how to buy coffee as there was none to be seen. There are kiosks set up,  so we approached one to try to figure things out. A salesperson finally asked us if we needed help. Yes wonderful. There is a clipboard with the coffees listed but no prices. She asks for my number so she can pull up my account. The first thing she tells me is that I don't qualify for the deal, but doesn't explain what the deal is. I ask her why not & it's because I haven't registered my machine on my account. Okay whatever, I just want coffee. So I ask her how this works. She explains the new coffees they have available. So I ask her what are the prices, she tells me (more than once), that they are the same prices as on their website. So finally I say to her well I don't have my phone in front of me & I don't have the prices memorized so is there a list of prices? No, she has to write them down. How does a store not have the prices of the items they are selling? Anyway, once we established the prices, we ordered our coffee, paid & within a couple of minutes she had our order ready to go. I think I would skip the store & stick to buying the coffee online, but you need to buy I believe 120 pods, which can run you about $150 to qualify for free shipping. As those are the only two methods to buying the Vertuo pods, I really wish I had thought all of this through before buying the machine, c'est la vie.",1,2020,3 years ago,2023-01-29 20:55:10,never thought buying coffee pretensious experience first time store bought machine coffee online wandered around trying figure buy coffee none seen kiosks set approached try figure things salesperson finally asked needed help wonderful coffees listed prices asks number pull account first thing tells qualify deal explain deal ask registered machine account want coffee ask works explains new coffees available ask prices tells prices website finally say phone front prices memorized list prices write store prices items selling anyway established prices ordered coffee paid couple minutes order ready go think store stick buying coffee online need buy believe pods run qualify free shipping methods buying pods really wish thought buying machine cest la vie,0,0,11,11,5,11,0,0,2,6

Francis Li,Local Guide,396,I have been a long time Nespresso customer and the customer service we got here was quite terrible. They treated my wife and I very poorly. The store had enough staff at the time and we had to flag someone to even get a sample because they were talking to each other. We waited a good 2-3 min before someone came to us to take our order. The downtown one did not have this problem nor did Oakridge. I recommend going there instead of this place. They prioritized people who were looking at machines than people who are going to get coffee.,1,2019,4 years ago,2023-01-29 20:55:10,long time customer customer service got quite terrible treated wife poorly store enough staff time flag even get sample talking waited good min came take order downtown problem oakridge recommend going instead place prioritized people looking machines people going get coffee,2,1,5,2,1,5,3,2,1,1

J A,Local Guide,222,Love this place. It really makes me glad I bought my Nespresso machine as it has changed my mornings. I haven't had a coffee at a Tim Horton's or Starbucks in nearly a year! I visit here frequently to taste the flavour of the week and try a new flavour. The Staff are all very personable and professional at the same time. They know their Nespresso coffee! You can ask them yourself. They demonstrate their skills as they speak to you and prepare your beverage 1 on 1. I've saved money from buying coffee everyday buy just using my VirtuoLine machine instead for a perfect cup that is reasonably priced. Other coffees taste like water now... You can really taste the difference.,5,2019,4 years ago,2023-01-29 20:55:10,love place really makes glad bought machine changed mornings coffee starbucks nearly year visit frequently taste week try new staff personable professional time know coffee ask demonstrate skills speak prepare beverage ve saved money buying coffee everyday buy using virtuoline machine instead perfect cup reasonably priced coffees taste water really taste difference,0,1,5,5,1,9,0,0,0,4

JJ BGS,Local Guide,55,"We usually get our cups via amazon. We were in the area so we figured we'd stop by. I'll keep it short-if you are not George Clooney expect some snootiness and attitude. We were served asap but our questions were met with attitude. Amazon gives us a few flavors so we asked the barista if we could mix and match. He gave us a confused look and said no, then went on to explain that the cups were not that expensive. We then went on to ask if we could have our free cup of coffee. He then went on to explain that they don't call them free because free denotes less class. They are called ""tasting cups."" Here's the thing Nespresso, if the cup doesn't cost me money, it is in fact a ""free"" cup of coffee. I don't need your barista to tell me otherwise. Anyways, awesome machine, great coffee. You'll probably never change but I'll be back to ask for my free cup of coffee.",1,2019,4 years ago,2023-01-29 20:55:10,usually get cups area figured stop keep clooney expect snootiness attitude served questions met attitude gives flavors asked barista mix match gave confused look said went explain cups expensive went ask free cup coffee went explain call free free denotes less class called tasting cups thing cup cost money fact free cup coffee need barista tell otherwise anyways awesome machine great coffee probably never change back ask free cup coffee,1,1,2,6,2,4,0,0,0,1
